## Overview
A fullstack application for creating personalized maps. The application allows you to create, edit and delete various objects on the map:
- Point
- Polyline
- Rectangle
- Polygon
- Circle

Each object created comes with a pop-up that can be personalized by changing the title, description or adding a photo.
In addition, the user can change the base map (e.g., topographic map) and the title of the created map. After the map is created, the effect can be saved and a unique code allowing the map to be loaded later will be sent to the specified email.
